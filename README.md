# for-fun
In this repository, I include some of the projects I have enjoyed the most while completing a 5-course specialization on deep-learning. 

# Important
I am sharing these projects for your reference and to illustrate how interesting deep learning projects are. If you are enrolled in a machine-learning/deep learning course and have an assignment similar to any of the projects that I present here, please do not copy this work. Instead, try to complete the assignment on your own with the help of the course material, instructors/TAs and the course discussion forum. 

# Project 1: Use a LSTM to generate Jazz music.
Objective: build and train a network to generate novel jazz solos in a style representative of a body of performed work.

Dataset: the dataset was provided by the course instructors and consisted on a snipped of jazz music audio. The audio was pre-processed and each music note was represented by one of 78 different possible values. Each training set consisted of a sequence of 30 notes (or music values). 

The model: The architecture of the model is shown in the figure below.
